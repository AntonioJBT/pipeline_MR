Steps to do for complete pipeline MR
########################################

######
- Manually change headers to 2SMR package for both exposure and outcome files
    + Minimum requirements for each SNP: effect sizes, standard errors and effect alleles
    + Ideally also obtain sample size, non-effect allele and effect allele frequency
######


######
- Script: pick genome-wide significant SNPs from exposure (at least p-val < 10e-5, ideally p-val < 10e-8) with replication in an independent sample eg:

  awk -F',' '($16 + 0) < 5E-08' model1_bolt.csv > significant_SNPs.csv
######


######
- Script: check rsIDs match current release and builds are the same for exposure and outcome
use ieugwasr package
######


######
- Script: Obtain proxy SNPs in high LD with exposure instruments (ideally r^2 = 1, at least > 0.8, from the same population). Ensure that the surrogate allele for the LD proxy SNPs are in phase with the effect allele of the original SNP.

TwoSampleMR uses 1000G EUR phase 3 only, see
https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR/issues/72

see eg:
https://github.com/katiedavis2918/VitaminD_Autoimmune_Conditions/blob/master/LDLinkR_proxies_Test.R

See also database from IEU or create own LD datasets
use ieugwasr package
######


######
- Script: extract exposure SNPs from outcome data eg:
  if from user dataset see ripgrep in pipeline
  otherwise use ieugwasr package
######


#######
- Script: standardise direction of alleles eg:
 Prob not needed as harmonise function does this:
https://github.com/XiyunJiang/Bilirubin_MSc_MR/blob/cef8894f3485a1de4974b51baf434d6fb0e981b6/Method_analysis/Traditional_MR/using_chisq_MR_analysis.R#L87

to line 135

Run 2SMR script with output from steps above

Script/function to obtain:
- Carry out power calculation:
    + See eg: http://cnsgenomics.com/shiny/mRnd/
    + Power in MR is determined by the sample size and strength of the association between instrument and exposure

- Do manual clumping retaining the SNP with lowest p-value and highest F-statistic

Script/function to obtain:
    + Instead of clumping keep all instruments, create LD matrix and use as covariate in MR methods (in e.g. MendelianRandomization R package).
    + Remove HLA SNPs, typically use only bi-allelic SNPs

Script/function to obtain:
9. Consider calculating and using a genetic risk score and repeating as above.
